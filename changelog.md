+ Added a smaller version of the item layout for those with smaller screens.
  + Changed the current version to a variant called "Expanded Layout," for those who still would like to use it.
  * The smaller version splits Deku Princess and Gold Dust apart from the normal bottles, which are now a counter up to 4.

+ Added Shopsanity as an option.
  * The Goron Shop is merged with Goron Village due to the lack of checks in the location.
